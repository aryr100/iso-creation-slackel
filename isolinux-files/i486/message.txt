 
 Welcome to 09Slackel __EDITION__07 version 6.0.5!

 Some PCs may require extra kernel options to function properly.
 If you need to pass extra parameters, enter them at the prompt below
 after the name of the kernel to boot (hugesmp.s) - USUALLY NOT NEEDED.
 EXAMPLE: hugesmp.s acpi=off

 NOTE: If your machine is not at least a Pentium-Pro, you *must* boot
 with the huge.s kernel, not the hugesmp.s kernel! For older machines,
 use "huge.s" at the boot prompt.

 This prompt is just for entering extra parameters.  If you don't need
 to enter any parameters, hit ENTER to boot the default kernel "hugesmp.s"
 and begin the installation of Slackel.

 *Following this page the kernel will load and a setup menu will appear*

 If you want to use this as a rescue system, just select to exit the
 installation at the main menu. You will then have access to a linux
 console. If from there you wish to go back to installing Slackel, just
 type "setup" in the linux console.
