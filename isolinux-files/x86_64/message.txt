Welcome to 09Slackel64 __EDITION__07 version 6.0.5!

If you need to pass extra parameters to the kernel, enter them at the prompt
below after the name of the kernel to boot (huge.s).

In a pinch, you can boot your system from here with a command like:

boot: huge.s root=/dev/sda1 rdinit= ro 

In the example above, /dev/sda1 is the / Linux partition.

This prompt is just for entering extra parameters.  If you don't need to enter
any parameters, hit ENTER to boot the default kernel "huge.s" and begin the 
installation of Slackel.

If you want to use this as a rescue system, just select to exit the
installation at the main menu. You will then have access to a linux console.
If from there you wish to go back to installing Slackel, just type "setup" in
the linux console.
